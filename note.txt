TIME TO GIT GOOD AT GIT
=======================




THE 3 STAGES OF GIT
===================

WORKING DIRECTORY
- This is where all the project and app files are held.

STAGING AREA
- aka the git index.
- This is the holding are for queueing up your changes that ready to be committed.

COMMIT
- This is where the code has been committed to the repository and is now recorded in history.

- We can also add a FOURTH GIT STATE for clarity...

THE REMOTE REPOSITORY (GitHub)
- The remote repo also has its own 3 stages like the local repo.




THE BRANCH
==========

- You can think of branches as timelines that contain the changes/deltas of your code.
