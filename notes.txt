TIME TO GIT GOOD AT GIT
=======================




THE 3 STAGES OF GIT
===================

WORKING DIRECTORY
- This is where all the project and app files are held.

STAGING AREA
- aka the git index.
- This is the holding are for queueing up your changes that ready to be committed.

COMMIT
- This is where the code has been committed to the repository and is now recorded in history.

- We can also add a FOURTH GIT STATE for clarity...

THE REMOTE REPOSITORY (GitHub)
- The remote repo also has its own 3 stages like the local repo.




THE BRANCH
==========

- You can think of branches as timelines that contain the changes/deltas of your code.




CONFIGURING YOUR GIT
====================

$ git config --global user.name "akexinad"
$ git config --global user.email "danixeka@gmail.com"

- now you can check if everything has been added correctly.

$ git config --global --list




- origin/master is the name of the master branch on the remote repo found on github.
    - Your branch is the master branch, the master branch in github is called the origin/master branch.
